## Software Engineer | .NET, Java, Angular, SQL

8 years of experience as a software developer in a dynamic small company, where I made significant contributions across multiple products.

The first half of my experience focused on the .NET platform (C#, WPF, MS SQL).
I then transitioned to Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Angular, according to the company's needs.

I'm currently located in Thailand, remote-ready, open to relocation opportunities.
